## Current Status
**Interest has been lost working on this project. I may resume at a later date.**

Open Volunteer is **pre-alpha**. This means it is still in the initial development phase and not ready for action yet.

## About Open Volunteer
The idea of Open Volunteer came from a need to recruite a large number of volunteers for a large scale event. The old way of emailing and calling proved to be a lot of work for the small team organizing the event. Trying to coordinate and fill available positions was done in a shared Google doc.

What I plan to accomplish with this project is to build and purpose built volunteer managment system for this organization as a bases. After that I plan to grow it's features and allow it to be more flexible so other organizations may use it and adapt it to their needs.

## Project Plans
These are the minimum requirements for a v1.0.0 release
- Simple login and roles (permissions) system
  - If it is simple then volunteers would want to use it
  - Add optional OAuth for Facebook, Twitter, Google
  - Optional 2FA (because every website should have it)
- Built on already existing frameworks (Laravel, Bootstrap...)
  - Cuts down on building code but adds to the learning curve for some
- Events and slots
  - Events can have single slot or many slots
  - Slots can set requirements for min/max volunteers
  - Once a volunteer signs up they can be approved, pending, rejected
- Notifications/Emails
  - Users can opt-in/out of various email/notification streams
  - Streams
    - Account (Cannot opt-out)
    - Newsletter
    - New event
    - Event reminder
    - Approved, rejected on event
    - Signup confirm

## About the Creator
My name is [Ben Hovinga](https://github.com/benhovinga) and I am a novice PHP programmer. I am taking on this project as a real test of my abilities and also to learn about how community open source projects are made. I plan to impliment tools very new to me and I invite anyone with interest and/or experience to help out with the project in any way.
